-Div is a root component for rendering, the other tags are its children. Will learn how to render adjacent elements without wrapping them in an parent element.
-Tag names are case-sensitive and non-HTML elements are capitalized.

Rendering with JSX

-We create new JSX elements so that we can encapsulate larger structures so you can use custom tags. The react component returns the JSX that goes where the tag is used.
-Namespaced Components: a namespaces provides and organizational unit fro your components so that related components can share the same namespace prefix. The idea of namespaced is to have a namespace component render its child components using the namespace syntax.
-JSX has a special syntax that allows you to embed JavaScript expressions. Anytime React renders JSX content, expressions in the markup are evaluated.This is the dynamic aspect of JSX.
-React evaluates expressions and updates the HTML content based on what has already been rendered and what has changed.
-Fragments are a way to group together chunks of markup without having to add unnecessary structure to your page.

Component Properties, State, and Context

-State is the dynamic part of a React component. You can declare the initial state of a component, which changes over 
time.
-Properties(props) are used to pass data into your React components. Instead of calling a method with a new state as teh argument, properties are passed only when the component is rendered.
-The initial state of a component isn't actually required, but if your component uses state, it should be set.
-The initial state of a component should always ben an object with one or more properties. 
-Properties are immutable, and there's no need for them to be kept as an instance property value. State, on the other hand, changes all the time, so the component needs an instance-level reference to it.
-You can pass just about anything you want as a property value via JSX, just as long as it's a valid JavaScript expression.
-A pure function is a function without side effects. That is to say, called with a given set of arguments, the function always produces the same output. This is relevant for React components because, given a set of properties, it's easier to predict what the rendered content will be. Functions that always return the same value with a given argument values are easier to test as well.
